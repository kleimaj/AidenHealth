# Iconography

Icons are an essential part of many user interfaces, visually expressing objects, actions and ideas.

<br/>

## Usage 

An iconâ€™s first job is to guide users to where they need to go, as well as a cohesive way of describing an item or action without text.

<br/>

### Badges

The badges are used to represent a product achievement. Badges are used sparingly, in order to invoke a significant meaning when they are used.

      <Badges />
  </Story>

### Social Icons

Social media icons make it easier for people to find your business on social media, helping you connect with your customers and increase your following.
